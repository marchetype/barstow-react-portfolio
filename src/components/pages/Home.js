        I am a 21 y/o bootcamp student from Charlottesville, Virginia 
        who is looking to enhance my creative ability through code. 
        In addition to development, my passions lie in the subjects of art, 
        design, and music production. It is my goal to be able to find a profession 
        that merges my intellectual and skill-based pursuits with the ability to 
        creatively display my talent.
